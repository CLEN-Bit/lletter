            <p>My Dearest Bebu &#9829;,</p>
            <p>No matter the distance between us, you are always in my heart. I am here for you, always and forever. You are my everything, and I cannot wait for the day when we can finally be together.</p>
            <p>I'm sorry for anything I've done that made you upset. I promise to never make you feel that way again. And if I do, I’ll make an even better sorry card than this one! (Consider this my practice run, okay?)</p>
            <p>Remember, I love you endlessly, and I’m here to make you smile, even from miles away.</p>
            <p>Yours forever,</p>
            <p>Your Bebu &#9829;</p>
